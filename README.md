# FakePy 1.0.0
### A brute-implemented naive FAKE interpreter.

Currently, FakePy has the following features and problems:
- It supports basic variable assignments and calculation.
- It supports declaration and implementation of functions.
- It supports if-else statements but the model is problematic in some senerios:
  - When dealing with local variables declared in the if-else loops when used in functions.
  - When dealing with multiple nested if blocks.
  - When dealing with condition lines when used in functions.
- Also, some operators and several functions are also not working as expected.

**The iterative loops will be added in the next update.**
*I'll try to make if-else block work as expected.*

But no one knows when I'll finish my plan. :)
